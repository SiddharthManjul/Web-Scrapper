# VestAO
VestAO is an asset streaming and distribution protocol bringing subscriptions, salaries, vesting, and rewards to DAOs and crypto-native businesses worldwide. This is made possible by the protocolâ€™s smart contract framework which introduces the Streaming Token - an extension to the basic AO Token standard enabling the transfer of value in time-based manner.
VestAO leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate and manage the vesting of assets, such as tokens, for participants in various financial programs. This type of platform is particularly useful for DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), crypto-native businesses, and projects that distribute tokens or other digital assets to contributors, investors, and employees.

## Key Features
### Smart Contract Automation: 
Smart Contracts ensure that vesting schedules and conditions are immutable and automatically enforced without the need for intermediaries. All transactions and vesting schedules are recorded on the blockchain providing transparency to all stakeholders.
